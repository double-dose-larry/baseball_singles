        <p class="subtitle">The concept of a pitcher win-loss record is dumb.</p>
        <p class="subtitle">Let's double-down it.</p>
    <article>
                <p>The pitcher win and loss is a poorly design stat.
                    <label for="sn-1"class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
                    <input type="checkbox" id="sn-1"class="margin-toggle"/>
                    <span class="sidenote">Show why they're dumb</span>.
                </p>

                <p> But they are also historically significant. Since the beginning of baseball, one of the most repoted on stat for pitchers has been the win-loss record.</p>
                <p>
                    For those that don't know a winning pitcher is defined as:
                </p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>The  Official  Scorer  shall  credit  as  the  winning  pitcher  that pitcher whose team assumes a lead while such pitcher is in the game, or during the inning on offense in which such pitcher is removed from the game, and does not relinquish such lead...</p>

                </blockquote>

                <p>The rule continues to list a few caveats and such, but I'd like to point out one thing here. <em>There is almost no mention about pitcher performance</em>. The only time the concept of pitcher performance is introduced is further in rule:</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p>The Official Scorer shall not credit as the winning pitcher arelief pitcher who is ineffective in a brief appearance, when atleast one succeeding relief pitcher pitches effectively in helpinghis team maintain its lead.</p>

                        </footer>  
                </blockquote>

                <p>Ok, that's just weird to me. Pitching performance matters for relievers, but not starting pitching. Why?</p>
                <p>But even this is poorly designed. One particularly hilarious situation that by rule must result in a pitcher win is if a home pitcher blows a lead at the top or the 9th or later inning and the home team ends up walking off in the bottom half.</p>
