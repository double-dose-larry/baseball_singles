        <h3>Why 1967?</h3>
       <p>The Cy Young award was first introduced in 1956 by Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick. 
           The award was originally given to the single best pitcher in the major leagues, 
           but in 1967, the award was given to one pitcher in each league. 
           This freed up the MVP award for (mostly) batters after that.
